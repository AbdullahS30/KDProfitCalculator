Understanding the Financial Model
The financial model in the CSV file is structured around different product categories, each with its own commission calculation method. The key categories are:

Fertilizer Calculator

Direct Inputs Calculator

Product Based Calculator

Crop Sales Calculator

Machine Sales Calculator

Each category has specific inputs and formulas to calculate the total commission. The model also provides a cumulative commission at the end, which sums up the commissions from all categories.

2. Key Inputs and Calculations
Fertilizer Calculator
Inputs:

KDL Market Penetration (Acres): Total land area (e.g., 100 acres).

Requirement per Acre: Amount of fertilizer needed per acre (e.g., 3 bags).

Total Requirement as per Acres: Total bags of fertilizer needed (e.g., 300 bags).

Average Commission per Unit: Commission per bag (e.g., PKR 77).

Calculation:

Total Commission = Total Requirement as per Acres * Average Commission per Unit

Example: 300 bags * PKR 77 = PKR 23,100

Direct Inputs Calculator
Inputs:

KDL Market Penetration (Acres): Total land area (e.g., 100 acres).

Average Gross Sales Value Per Acre: Sales value per acre (e.g., PKR 1,500).

Average Commission Percentage: Commission percentage (e.g., 13.70%).

Calculation:

Total Commission = Total Acres * Average Gross Sales Value Per Acre * Average Commission Percentage

Example: 100 acres * PKR 1,500 * 13.70% = PKR 20,550

Product Based Calculator
Inputs:

Quantity: Number of products sold (e.g., 50 units).

Average Gross Sales Value: Sales value per unit (e.g., PKR 2,500).

Average Commission Percentage: Commission percentage (e.g., 2.86%).

Calculation:

Total Commission = Quantity * Average Gross Sales Value * Average Commission Percentage

Example: 50 units * PKR 2,500 * 2.86% = PKR 3,575

Crop Sales Calculator
Inputs:

Paidawar Land Booked (Acres): Total land area (e.g., 100 acres).

Average Yield per Acre (Maunds): Yield per acre (e.g., 40 maunds).

Last Approx Price per Maund: Price per maund (e.g., PKR 3,700).

Average Commission Percentage: Commission percentage (e.g., 0.30%).

Calculation:

Total Commission = Total Acres * Average Yield per Acre * Last Approx Price per Maund * Average Commission Percentage

Example: 100 acres * 40 maunds * PKR 3,700 * 0.30% = PKR 44,400

Machine Sales Calculator
Inputs:

Machine Orders Booked (Acres): Total land area (e.g., 200 acres).

Average Cost per Acre: Cost per acre (e.g., PKR 6,000).

Average Commission Percentage: Commission percentage (e.g., 2%).

Calculation:

Total Commission = Total Acres * Average Cost per Acre * Average Commission Percentage

Example: 200 acres * PKR 6,000 * 2% = PKR 24,000

3. Cumulative Commission Calculation
The cumulative commission is the sum of all individual commissions from the different categories. In the example provided, the total cumulative commission is PKR 114,225.

4. Profit Calculation for Licensee
To calculate the profit for a licensee, you need to consider the total revenue generated from sales and subtract any costs associated with the products. The commission earned by the licensee is part of their profit.

Total Revenue: Sum of revenue from all product categories.

Total Costs: Sum of costs associated with purchasing the products.

Total Commission: Sum of commissions from all categories.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs + Total Commission

5. Building the Calculator
User Inputs:
Land Area: Total available land in acres.

Product Mix: Selection of products (fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, machines, crops).

Quantity: Number of units or bags for each product.

Sales Value: Average sales value per unit or per acre.

Calculations:
For each product category, calculate the total commission using the formulas provided.

Sum up all commissions to get the cumulative commission.

Calculate total revenue and subtract costs to determine profit.

Scenario Planning:
Allow users to simulate different sales mixes by adjusting the product quantities and sales values.

Show how changes in the product mix affect total commissions and profits.

User Interface:
Ensure the interface is simple and intuitive, with clear input fields and results displayed prominently.

Provide visualizations (e.g., charts) to help users understand the impact of different scenarios.

6. Example Scenario
Let's say a licensee has 150 acres of land and wants to sell the following products:

Fertilizer: 450 bags (3 bags per acre) at PKR 77 commission per bag.

Seeds & Pesticides: PKR 1,500 sales value per acre at 13.70% commission.

Crops: 150 acres with 40 maunds per acre at PKR 3,700 per maund and 0.30% commission.

Machines: 150 acres at PKR 6,000 cost per acre and 2% commission.

Calculations:

Fertilizer Commission: 450 * 77 = PKR 34,650

Seeds & Pesticides Commission: 150 * 1,500 * 13.70% = PKR 30,825

Crop Commission: 150 * 40 * 3,700 * 0.30% = PKR 66,600

Machine Commission: 150 * 6,000 * 2% = PKR 18,000

Total Commission: PKR 34,650 + 30,825 + 66,600 + 18,000 = PKR 150,075

Profit Calculation:

Assume total costs are PKR 500,000 and total revenue is PKR 1,200,000.

Profit: 1,200,000 - 500,000 + 150,075 = PKR 850,075

This example demonstrates how the calculator can help licensees estimate their commissions and profits based on their land size and product mix.
